5/1/2018 I think that SFML 2.4.2 is compiled with g++-4.8, so I had to explicitly use g++ because the default is now 5. I think since I compiled gtest and gmock with 4.8, it also needs 4.8.
But I need at least 4.8 because I need make_unique. I made my own.
Now, Gtest isn't working again probably because my default is 5.0.
Recompiled gtest on 4.8. Had to delete the existing ones in my lib in order for the changes to take effect.

5/2/2018 I moved my libs to /usr/local/lib and lib64, I had to add those paths
to /etc/ld.so.conf because I was getting a 'cannot open shared object libraries'
error when running tiengine.
