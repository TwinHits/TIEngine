sudo apt-get install libvorbisfile3/1/2018 I think that SFML 2.4.2 is compiled with g++-4.8, so I had to explicitly use g++ because the default is now 5. I think since I compiled gtest and gmock with 4.8, it also needs 4.8.
But I need at least 4.8 because I need make_unique. I made my own.
Now, Gtest isn't working again probably because my default is 5.0.
Recompiled gtest on 4.8. Had to delete the existing ones in my lib in order for the changes to take effect.

5/2/2018 I moved my libs to /usr/local/lib and lib64, I had to add those paths
to /etc/ld.so.conf because I was getting a 'cannot open shared object libraries'
error when running tiengine. 

5/6/2018 For #7 I moved ParseLanguageConfig to its own utility class. That
caused an unresolved external error. This happened because I added the files
as existing items in order to maintain their folder position and get aronud
VS's filter system, but I forgot to change their properties from text to .h
and .cpp.

2/5/2020 After doing a sudo apt autoremove (I think) a bunch of stuff got removed. The errors looked like:
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libvorbisfile.so.3, needed by ../lib/SFML-2.5.1/lib/libsfml-audio.so.2.5.1, not found (try using
-rpath or -rpath-link)

I fixed by googling the names of those so. I followed this post but without the i386

I got a similar warning to above on a fresh WSL2 install and solved it with
sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev

windows could not find boost until I b2.exe'd with flags
.\b2.exe  release debug threading=multi --build-type=complete --toolset=msvc address-model=64 stage

Git would show that there were tons of changes in linux hacing to do with ending all of the lines with ^M. I fixed this with git command
git config --global core.autocrlf true

Notes.txt before I deleted it:
Put the SFML libraries downloaded from the website in the lib folder
Set the CMAKE variable to the correct folder.
	set(SFML_DIR "./SFML-2.5.1/lib/cmake/SFML")

Need Xming running on windows or there will be an X error.

For I think the third time, I forgot about that you're supposed to do ./bootstrap and then ./b2 to build boost once you've downloaded it. It could not find filesystem until I did.

I had a ton of problems installing boost, first abut not being able to find cl and then some header problems.
1. Make sure you download the right version of boost
2. make sure when installing visual studio that you check mark the desktop build tools or no compiler will actually be installed, and the 'universal' tools box as well. Not sure if both these are necessary.

Trying to install pybind11 and had to upgrade to visual studio 2022 because I was getting end of life warnings. This
messed up cmake. I got an error about unable to find cl, which I fixed by adding the new visual studio to the
environment variables.
Then I got an error about mt.exe, which is some windows SDK thing. I found it in windows Kits/bin and picked the highest
version and x64 and added it to the PATH, that fixed it but I don't reall understand why.
