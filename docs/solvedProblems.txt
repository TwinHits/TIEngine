udo apt-get install libvorbisfile3/1/2018 I think that SFML 2.4.2 is compiled with g++-4.8, so I had to explicitly use g++ because the default is now 5. I think since I compiled gtest and gmock with 4.8, it also needs 4.8.
But I need at least 4.8 because I need make_unique. I made my own.
Now, Gtest isn't working again probably because my default is 5.0.
Recompiled gtest on 4.8. Had to delete the existing ones in my lib in order for the changes to take effect.

5/2/2018 I moved my libs to /usr/local/lib and lib64, I had to add those paths
to /etc/ld.so.conf because I was getting a 'cannot open shared object libraries'
error when running tiengine. 

5/6/2018 For #7 I moved ParseLanguageConfig to its own utility class. That
caused an unresolved external error. This happened because I added the files
as existing items in order to maintain their folder position and get aronud
VS's filter system, but I forgot to change their properties from text to .h
and .cpp.

2/5/2020 After doing a sudo apt autoremove (I think) a bunch of stuff got removed. The errors looked like:
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libvorbisfile.so.3, needed by ../lib/SFML-2.5.1/lib/libsfml-audio.so.2.5.1, not found (try using
-rpath or -rpath-link)

I fixed by googling the names of those so. I followed this post but without the i386

I got a similar warning to above on a fresh WSL2 install and solved it with
sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev

windows could not find boost until I b2.exe'd with flags
.\b2.exe  release debug threading=multi --build-type=complete --toolset=msvc address-model=64 stage

Git would show that there were tons of changes in linux hacing to do with ending all of the lines with ^M. I fixed this with git command
git config --global core.autocrlf true
