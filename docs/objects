SceneObject:
	An object that is not a player and is a sprite. 
	SendMessage(msg): Every object sends out messages every frame with
			information that other objects can act on
	GetMessage(msg): Every object is listening for certain messages every frame that they
			are to act on
	When an object must do a thing, it puts the thing into it's queue.
	Each update, it looks at each thing in it's queue and checks if its
requirements are filled.
	If so, it removes it from the queue.
	This lets the object do more than one thing at once.
	Individual commands are expected to know their dependencies on other things.
