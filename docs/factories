Factory based object creation:
	Every time that a client wants to make a new object, they have to make the
object class from SceneObject, and a factory from SceneObjectFactory.
	The SceneObjectFactory class is templated and has a create function that
passes and allocated T pointer to ObjectManager. ObjectManager is only responsible for
storing and deleting objects at shut down, not for creation.
