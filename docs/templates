Singleton:
	Templated Singleton class that allows classes to inherit Singleton like
attributes.

Factory:
	Templated Factory class that adds all created objects to the
SceneObjectManager. Must be templated after a derived type of SceneObject.
		Dervided factories must call the base template's create function passing
in a shared_ptr. This is so that the client can call whatever constructors they
like. Options for returning ptrs, refs, and for when no constructor needs to be
called are also offered.
