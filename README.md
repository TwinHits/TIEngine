This Twin Ion Engine (TIEngine), a game engine utilizing the SFML libray.

It's objective is to do the low level work for you, so that you can focus on
making game objects and gameplay rules, and less on worrying about object
management, logging, window management, and game loops.

To install, clone to your machine and run 'make'. This will produce a
libTIEngine-debug in bin/. Move to lib folder of your choice.

See docs for documentation for avaliable classes and methods.
